# Aviatrix Docs Mintlify

This folder will contain the migrated documentation from Antora/AsciiDoc to Mintlify/MDX format.

## Structure
- Each Antora module from the `modules/` directory will be migrated as a subfolder here.
- Each module will contain its pages, images, and navigation files, converted to MDX and Mintlify-compatible structure.

## Example Layout
- aviatrix-docs-mintlify/
  - getting-started/
  - network/
  - security/
  - monitoring/
  - best-practices/
  - platform-administration/
  - uservpn/
  - what-is-new/
  - release-notices/
  - ROOT/

Further structure and content will be added as modules are migrated.
