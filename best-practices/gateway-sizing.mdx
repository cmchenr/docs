# Gateway Sizing Best Practices Guide

Although Aviatrix supports a wide array of instance types and sizes in each cloud, this reference guide provides data about gateway sizing and common deployments by other Aviatrix customers to assist you with pre-deployment planning, as well as to help right-size current deployments to maximize cost savings and efficiency.

> **Note:** This data is for guidance purposes only and is based on Aviatrix Controller software version 7.2.4820. Every environment may perform differently.

## Gateway Size Distribution

Transit Gateways are typically larger because they serve as the hub of a hub-and-spoke architecture, terminating multiple Spoke Gateways. This means Transit Gateways need more IPsec throughput and performance compared to Spoke Gateways, which service only one VPC/VNET/VCN of workloads.

The following tables and graphs (see original documentation for images) show data for AWS and Azure cloud deployments:

## Bandwidth and Performance
Gateway performance is impacted by packet size. In Aviatrix internal testing, both best-case large payload numbers and Internet Mix (iMix) numbers of varying packet sizes were used to reflect more real-world performance numbers.
